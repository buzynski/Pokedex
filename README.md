## Pokedex

# Description
#### API:
https://pokeapi.co
#### Stack:
- kotlin
- mvvm
- data/view binding
- JetPack Navigation
- LiveData
- koin
- retrofit
- coroutines
- custom progressbar

#### Product flavours:
- apiProduction
- apiMocked

#### Build types:
- release
- debug
- qa

I'v added keystore.properties into the repo, so you can build release as well.
apiMockedQa was excluded from build variants as it was mentioned in task.

#### Things todo / to improve (plan for the future):
- adding some unit tests
- in pokemon preview show more information, not just only characteristic
- get rid of databinding (this is was the last project where i use it)
